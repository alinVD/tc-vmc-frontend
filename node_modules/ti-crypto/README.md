# tiCrypto

Crypto suite for tiCrypt.

## Usage

For use in Typescript that will be *properly* compiled (i.e. module resolution, bundling, etc.),
you can simply use:

```javascript
import {...} from "tiCrypto";
import * as tiCrypto from "tiCrypto";
import tiCrypto = require("tiCrypto");
```

Otherwise, types can be grabbed from `dist/index.ts`, and Javascript can be sourced from either
`dist/tiCrypto.js` or `dist/tiCrypto.min.js`.

## Testing

```
npm install
npm test
```

## Building

```
npm install
npm i -g babel-minify // no idea if global dependencies can be added to package.json
npm start
```
